On October 5th, I was the speaker at the symfony day, and I was lucky enough to be able to close the conference.

It was a very interesting experience, although excited I talked about what I know best: improving the performance of a web application.

\[edit\] Two months after the talk, visitors pass the 1,200 visits (December 2012).

There were a lot of other interesting talk:

**Symfony2 Security Layer** - by @K3A, explained in detail the most difficult part of the symfony documentation.

**PHPUnit raised by Symfony2** of @euxpom, showed how many utensils you have for free by the Symfony2 framework

**Symfony CMF** of @jacoporomei described with an overwhelming sympathy a subject very dear to me the CMF and his architecture.


See you next year [symfonyday.it](http://www.symfonyday.it)
